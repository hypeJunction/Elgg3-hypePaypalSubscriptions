Paypal integration for hypeSubscriptions

## Disclaimer

PayPal sucks and so does its API. I have written this plugin to test the flexibility of the subscriptions API. Personally, I would discourage anyone from using PayPal, until they get their act together, hire an army of developers and get up to speed with the developments in the financial e-services.

During testing, I have noticed that PayPal doesn't properly synchronize payment information with billing agreements, so it's really impossible to keep track of changes in real-time. You may end up having to manually consolidate transactions and refunds.
